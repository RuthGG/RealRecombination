     Panel 1: unphased reference genotypes
     Panel 2: unphased study genotypes

For optimal results, each successive panel (0,1,2) should contain a subset of the SNPs in the previous panel. When the data structure deviates from this ideal configuration, IMPUTE2 tries to use as much of the available information as possible; see documentation for details.

 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0
  [0.1-0.2]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.1]    -nan          0.0

  [0.3-0.4]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.3]    -nan          0.0
  [0.4-0.5]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.4]    -nan          0.0

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0

 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0
  [0.1-0.2]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.1]    -nan          0.0

  [0.3-0.4]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.3]    -nan          0.0

 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0
  [0.1-0.2]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.1]    -nan          0.0

 Nomenclature and data structure 
---------------------------------

     Panel 1: unphased reference genotypes
     Panel 2: unphased study genotypes

For optimal results, each successive panel (0,1,2) should contain a subset of the SNPs in the previous panel. When the data structure deviates from this ideal configuration, IMPUTE2 tries to use as much of the available information as possible; see documentation for details.

For optimal results, each successive panel (0,1,2) should contain a subset of the SNPs in the previous panel. When the data structure deviates from this ideal configuration, IMPUTE2 tries to use as much of the available information as possible; see documentation for details.

--------------------------------
 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0
  [0.1-0.2]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.1]    -nan          0.0
  [0.2-0.3]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.2]    -nan          0.0
  [0.3-0.4]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.3]    -nan          0.0
  [0.4-0.5]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.4]    -nan          0.0
  [0.5-0.6]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.5]    -nan          0.0
  [0.6-0.7]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.6]    -nan          0.0

 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0
  [0.1-0.2]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.1]    -nan          0.0

     Panel 1: unphased reference genotypes
     Panel 2: unphased study genotypes

For optimal results, each successive panel (0,1,2) should contain a subset of the SNPs in the previous panel. When the data structure deviates from this ideal configuration, IMPUTE2 tries to use as much of the available information as possible; see documentation for details.

 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0
  [0.1-0.2]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.1]    -nan          0.0

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0
  [0.1-0.2]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.1]    -nan          0.0

 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0
  [0.1-0.2]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.1]    -nan          0.0
  [0.2-0.3]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.2]    -nan          0.0
  [0.3-0.4]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.3]    -nan          0.0
  [0.4-0.5]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.4]    -nan          0.0

 Nomenclature and data structure 
---------------------------------

     Panel 1: unphased reference genotypes
     Panel 2: unphased study genotypes

For optimal results, each successive panel (0,1,2) should contain a subset of the SNPs in the previous panel. When the data structure deviates from this ideal configuration, IMPUTE2 tries to use as much of the available information as possible; see documentation for details.

 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0

--------------------------------
 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0
  [0.1-0.2]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.1]    -nan          0.0
  [0.2-0.3]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.2]    -nan          0.0
  [0.3-0.4]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.3]    -nan          0.0
  [0.4-0.5]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.4]    -nan          0.0
  [0.5-0.6]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.5]    -nan          0.0
  [0.6-0.7]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.6]    -nan          0.0

 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0
  [0.1-0.2]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.1]    -nan          0.0

 Nomenclature and data structure 
---------------------------------

     Panel 1: unphased reference genotypes
     Panel 2: unphased study genotypes

For optimal results, each successive panel (0,1,2) should contain a subset of the SNPs in the previous panel. When the data structure deviates from this ideal configuration, IMPUTE2 tries to use as much of the available information as possible; see documentation for details.

---------------------------------
 Nomenclature and data structure 
---------------------------------

     Panel 1: unphased reference genotypes
     Panel 2: unphased study genotypes

For optimal results, each successive panel (0,1,2) should contain a subset of the SNPs in the previous panel. When the data structure deviates from this ideal configuration, IMPUTE2 tries to use as much of the available information as possible; see documentation for details.

 Imputation accuracy assessment 
--------------------------------

The table below is based on an internal cross-validation that is performed during each IMPUTE2 run. For this analysis, the program masks the genotypes of one variant at a time in the study data (Panel 2) and imputes the masked genotypes by using the remaining study and reference data. The imputed genotypes are then compared with the original genotypes to produce the concordance statistics shown in the table. You can learn more about this procedure and the contents of the table at http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/concordance_table_description.html.

In the current analysis, IMPUTE2 masked, imputed, and evaluated 0 genotypes that were called with high confidence (maximum probability >= 0.90) in the Panel 2 input file (-g or -known_haps_g).

When the masked study genotypes were imputed with reference data from Panel 1, the concordance between original and imputed genotypes was as follows:

  Interval  #Genotypes %Concordance         Interval  %Called %Concordance
  [0.0-0.1]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.0]    -nan          0.0
  [0.1-0.2]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.1]    -nan          0.0
  [0.2-0.3]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.2]    -nan          0.0
  [0.3-0.4]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.3]    -nan          0.0
  [0.4-0.5]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.4]    -nan          0.0
  [0.5-0.6]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.5]    -nan          0.0
  [0.6-0.7]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.6]    -nan          0.0
  [0.7-0.8]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.7]    -nan          0.0
  [0.8-0.9]          0          0.0         [ >= 0.8]    -nan          0.0
