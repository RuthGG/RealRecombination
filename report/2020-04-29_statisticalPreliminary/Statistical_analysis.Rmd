library(ggplot2)

```

Data was public. 
With bedtools intersect I took all crossovers that overlapped in any way with an inversion. 

```{r upload_files}
croxinv<-read.table("results/statistical_analysis/crossovers_x_inversions.txt", sep = "\t" )
croxinv<-croxinv[croxinv$V3 == "inversion",]
croxinv$coordinates<-paste0(croxinv$V10,":", croxinv$V11,"-", croxinv$V12)
croxinv<-croxinv[,c(14, 9, 13 )]
croxinv$V9<-sub("ID=\\d+;Name=", "", croxinv$V9)
croxinv$V9<-sub(";.*$", "", croxinv$V9)
# split croxinv

genotypes<-read.csv("individuals_imputation.csv", row.names =  1)
```

First of all, I want a table with amount of recombination events per sperm sample overlapping with an inversion

```{r events_cell}



```
